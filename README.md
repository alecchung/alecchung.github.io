# My Projects

## 1. Todo List

- A simple MERN stack web application: MongoDB + Express + ReactJS + NodeJS.

- CRUD implementation: Create, read, update & delete.

- Technologies used: react-icons/md, react-tooltip, react-toastify

### How to Use

It's designed to be simple and straightforward to use. And Tool Tips are in place to help. 

- Type in your todo task in the input field of the form, and then press the "Add" button to add the task to your todo list. Press the ENTER key works too. The input field can't be empty though, or you'll be greeted with a kind reminder to fill out the field. 

- Click on the green tick symbol to mark an todo as done, provided it's not done already. When an todo is marked as done, the green tick will turn gray. 

- To edit an existing todo, click on the blue pencil symbol. By doing this, the original content of the todo will be sent to the input field, where you make your changes. The "Add" button in this case will be changed to "Edit" correspondingly. Click on the "Edit" button to submit your changed todo and send it to the list. Done todos can be edited as well, and it'll be marked as undone after you have edited it. 

- To delete a todo, click on the red trash can symbol. 

- Each operation comes with react-toastify notifications. And two numbers are updated automatically: the total number of todos, and the number of done todos. 

## 2. Hangman

- The world renowned Hangman word game, but in German, i.e. Galgenmännchen.

- Build with TypeScript.

- Handled tricky problems imposed by the German language - German umlauts (ä,ö,ü) and the sharp S (ß) , to be exact. 

### How to Play

- At the start of the game, a random German word will be chosen as the word to be guessed. Its length varies from 5 to 15, and it is your job to find out this word in order to save the poor man from hanging in there. 

- You can simply click on any of the possible letters on the visual keyboard: 26 common letters, plus four more to give you the German flavor - ä,ö,ü and ß. 

- Typing with your physical keyboard works too - you'll just have to figure out how to type ä,ö,ü and ß yourself, which depends on your keyboard configuration. 

- If your input has its place(s) in the word to guess, it will be shown, and accordingly, the letter will be marked as a blue square, meaning that you have guessed it right and could therefore leave it out in the following guesses. 

- If your input is not in the word to guess, the poor hangman will start to materialize in the gallows, and accordingly, the letter will be marked as gray. Note that the hangman consists of six parts - the head, the body, the two arms, and the two legs. Therefore, you are allowed to make six wrong guesses.

- When you successfully figure out all the letters in the word to guess, congratulations, you have won and saved the hangman. If you anyhow exhausted your six chances, sorry, you lose. Either way, you will be greeted with a popup box, and the word to guess will be shown in full. Now you can start anew, by clicking on the "Neustarten" (German for "restart") button.

- You can always restart the game by pressing ENTER or ESC, be it you have reached the end or not. 

### What's next

- An additional feature could be to display the definition of that word, if there won't be any copyright issues. 

- With user accounts in place, we can an arena out this game, with records of your success rates with each German word. A Hall of Fame is sure to happen.
