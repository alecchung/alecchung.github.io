# My Creative Projects

My Portfolio website itself is a full stack project, with backend support from Sanity. Beside that, I have four other projects, small and big: 

## Todo List

- A simple MERN application: MongoDB + Express + ReactJS + Node.

- CRUD implementation of to-dos: Create, read, update & delete.

## Hangman

- A simple word game, but in German

- Build with TypeScript

- Handled tricky problems imposed by the German language - German umlauts and the sharp S (ÃŸ) , to be exact. 

## Travel Agency Website

- **MERN project** with the ability to retrieve and update MongoDB database. 

- Register/Login functionalities. 

- Comment handling with proper authorization. 

## Admin Dashboard

- **MERN project** built with Material UI design

- Dark/Light mode support

- Graphic rich for showcasing dashboard data, and could easily be expanded and customized.
